# AI Calendar Assistant
This project helps you manage your calendar with the help of AI. I designed it to all run locally and offline, which means you need a decent GPU to run HERMES 2 Pro. The prompts are still very finicky. Main assistant is in total_assistant.py . **THIS PROJECT ONLY WORKS ON LINUX.** While there is technically limited support for windows, the process corrupted my boot files, so I would not recommend it 
## Requirements
You will need SpeechRecognition, Pyaudio, and Phi assistant (instructions to come)
## Running
Delete everything in calendar.json and run cal.py
